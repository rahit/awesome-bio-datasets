### The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)
http://exac.broadinstitute.org/  
ExAC is a coalition of investigators seeking to aggregate and harmonize exome sequencing data from a variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and to make summary data available for the wider scientific community. The data set provided on this website spans 61,486 unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies. We have removed individuals affected by severe pediatric disease, so this data set should serve as a useful reference set of allele frequencies for severe disease studies. All of the raw data from these projects have been reprocessed through the same pipeline, and jointly variant-called to increase consistency across projects.
